# Expense Tracker App

This is a self-learning project where I developed an expense tracker web application using **React JS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **Material-UI (MUI)**, **Axios**, and **Firebase**.

## Features

- Add new expenses with detailed information (e.g., amount, date, description)
- View a **bar chart** that visualizes expenses for different months of the year
- See a list of all expenses for easy tracking and management
- Responsive design using **Bootstrap** and **MUI**
- Data stored and managed with **Firebase** backend
- Axios integration for API calls and data handling

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: For building the user interface
- **HTML** and **CSS**: For page structure and styling
- **Bootstrap** and **MUI**: For responsive design and components
- **Axios**: For handling API requests
- **Firebase**: For backend services including database and authentication

## How It Works

1. Users can add a new expense by entering details such as amount, date, and description.
2. A bar chart displays the total expenses for each month of the year.
3. Users can view all expenses in a list format to track their spending.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Set up Firebase with your project credentials to enable backend functionality. You can find the instructions on the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).
